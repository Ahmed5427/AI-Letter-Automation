### How It Works

1. When a letter is generated, the system now calls `populateDocumentTemplate()` function
2. This function takes the generated letter data and form inputs
3. It dynamically populates the document template with:
   - Current date and Hijri date
   - Generated letter number
   - Recipient information (name, title, organization)
   - Letter title based on type and purpose
   - Formatted letter content
   - Sender information

### Template Structure

The document template includes:
- **Header**: Company logo, name, and contact details with date information
- **Title**: Document type and purpose
- **Recipient Section**: Formal addressing with title and organization
- **Greeting**: Traditional Arabic greeting
- **Content**: Generated letter body formatted as paragraphs
- **Closing**: Formal closing statement
- **Signature**: Sender information and title
- **Footer**: Generation notice

### Usage

The template automatically activates when:
1. User fills out the letter form
2. Clicks "Generate Letter" button
3. System generates the letter content
4. Preview section displays the professional document template

Users can switch between template views using the radio buttons:
- "القالب الرسمي" (Formal Template) - Shows the new document template
- "القالب الحديث" (Modern Template) - Shows the simple textarea

### Technical Notes

- The template is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes
- CSS Grid and Flexbox are used for modern layout techniques
- The template supports RTL (right-to-left) text direction for Arabic
- Print styles are optimized for A4 paper size
- All styling follows modern web standards

### Testing

The implementation has been tested locally and successfully displays:
- Proper document formatting
- Dynamic content population
- Template switching functionality
- Responsive design on different screen sizes
- Print preview compatibility

This update significantly enhances the user experience by providing a professional, document-like preview that matches the quality expected from formal letter generation systems.
